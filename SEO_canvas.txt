// SEO success factors //

- Vc (Cloaking/-3/BAD); the police of the top menu, which appears when menu hovered over, 
is white and not contrasting enough with the background photo. The words get a little bit lost. 
The dark red color is takes when hovered is not much better for this particular photo. 

- As (Speed/+1/Neutral); Speed of loading is O.K., but not the fastest.

- Cw (Words/+2/BAD); Wording can be a bit troublesome on this website. In the menu it can be 
confusing what design tab stands for. Should rather be technology or a more specific term. Same with stories

- Ht (HTML titles/GOOD); title of page = Rocky Mountain Bicycles, word bikes used in HTML as well /
pretty good, people may search bicycles or mountain bikes

- Pc (Country/+3//GOOD); It is SUPER easy to select the area you want to website to assume you are from/in. 

- Ph (History/+3/BAD); This website does not take into account previous visits or search
